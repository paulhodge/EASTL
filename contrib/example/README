This directory contains a set of examples of EASTL usage.

To compile them, you must have already built 'libeastl.a' in the root
directory of the souce tree.

Afterwords, to build the examples you can just run 'make' - you can
build individual executables by running 'make <foo>.exe' where 'foo'
is the specific example, e.g. 'make custom_allocator.exe'
